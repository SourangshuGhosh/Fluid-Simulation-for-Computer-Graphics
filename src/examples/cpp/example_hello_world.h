    An important note to make about addImplicitFluidPoint is that it will not 
    add a sphere with the specified radius, it will add a sphere with half of 
    the specified radius. An implicit fluid point is represented as a field of 
    values on the simulation grid. The strength of the field values are 1 at the
	point center and falls off towards 0 as distance from the point increases. 
	When the simulation is initialized, fluid particles will be created in 
	regions where the field values are greater than 0.5. This means that if you 
	add a fluid point with a radius of 6.0, the ball of fluid in the simulation 
	will actually be of radius 3.0 since field values will be less than 0.5 at 
	a distance greater than half of the specified radius.

    The fluid simulation in this example is quick to compute, but of low quality 
    due to the low resolution of the simulation grid. The quality of this 
    simulation can be improved by increasing the simulation dimensions while 
    decreasing the cell size. For example, try simulating on a grid of 
    resolution 64 x 64 x 64 with a cell size of 0.125, or even better, on a grid 
    of resolution 128 x 128 x 128 with a cell size of 0.0625.
